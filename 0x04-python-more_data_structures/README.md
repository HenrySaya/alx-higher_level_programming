0-square_matrix_simple.py
This particular function handles matrices.
I bilt it in such a way thet it computes the square of all integers of a given matrix.
Matrix is a 2d array
Function basically returns a new matrix that is same size, and each value is the square of the value of the input.
Tested it with test1.py file that is in a directory named testinputs.

1-search_replace.py
This function is built in a way that it will search for an element in a given list and check if the value corresponds with what is being searched for.
After the search is matched it will replace this elemnt with the specified replacement element.
my_list is the initial list as seen in 2test.py, search is the element to be replaced amd replace is the new element.

2_uniq_add.py
This is a function that will add all unique integers in a list that is only once for each digit no repetition of sum of a similar integer.
This I did by passing the set() function against my_list so that when sum is carried out in the function only uniwque entries are summed up.
