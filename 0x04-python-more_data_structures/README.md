0-square_matrix_simple.py
This particular function handles matrices.
I bilt it in such a way thet it computes the square of all integers of a given matrix.
Matrix is a 2d array
Function basically returns a new matrix that is same size, and each value is the square of the value of the input.
Tested it with test1.py file that is in a directory named testinputs.
