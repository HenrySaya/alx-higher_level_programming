## 0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions
This direcctory conains a sequence of tasks that have been handled well and executed to perfection in the following files.
Each file achieved a particular task and I have described it cearly along the file name
Below are the files and also a short description on them to get an insiht of what was done and what it achieved

0-positive_or_negative.py
This file is a python script that assigns a random number to variable number each time it is executed
The random number is then passed through the conditionals(if statements) , whereby if the number is greater than 0 the program outputs nmber is positve as well as the remaining 3 conditionals that are structured in the if... elif...else structure

1-last_digit.py
This is another python scriipt whereby a random number will be assigned to our variable number each time it is executed
This output of this script is a string followed by the last digit of the number followed by the number.
Now if the last difit is greater than 5 for example, outputs the string along with statement and is greater than 5 as well as other conditionals i have implemented on tthe if statements

2-print_alphabet.py
In this python script by using for loop, the program prints ASCII alphabet in lowercase and not followed by a newline

3-print_alphabt.py
This pythpn script works the same way as the above scrpt only that in here we wont print out characters e and q

4-print_hexa.py
This is a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 and their equivalent hexadecimal values

5-print_comb2.py
this is a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99 in ascending order with tw0 digits.
last number is followed by a newline
Rest of the numbers are separated by , followed by space and all done in one for loop with two print statements with string.format

6-print_comb3.py
This is a program that prints all the possible combination of two digits whereby 01 and 10 are considered same combination thus our combination is unique in that sense

7-islower.py
This is a function (islower()) that checks for lowercase letters
Returns true if c is lowercase and false otherwise
Used main.py to test the function

8-uppercase.py
This is a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a newline

9-print_last_digit.py
This is a function that prints the last diggit of a number.
Tested against lasty.py in the test files
